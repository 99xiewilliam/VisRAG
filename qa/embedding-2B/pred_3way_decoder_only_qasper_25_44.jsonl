We\ntherefore surmise that whenever some information\nis encoded in one representation but not in the other,\ngiving BERT both representations is helpful.\nBy default, the set of contexts C for each\nword is obtained by collecting all sentences from\nWWC+BookCorpus in which it occurs. We also\ntry a variant where we add in-domain contexts by\ngiving BERTRAM access to all texts (but not la-\nbels) found in the test set; we refer to this variant as\nINDOMAIN.6 Our motivation for including this vari-\nant is as follows: Moving from the training stage of\na model to its production use often causes a slight\ndomain shift. This is turn leads to an increased\nnumber of input sentences containing words that\ndid not – or only very rarely – appear in the training\ndata. However, such input sentences can easily be\ncollected as additional unlabeled examples during\nproduction use. While there is no straightforward\nway to leverage these unlabeled examples with an\nalready ﬁnetuned BERT model, BERTRAM can eas-\nily make use of them without requiring any labels\nor any further training: They can simply be in-\ncluded as additional contexts during inference. As\nthis gives BERTRAM a slight advantage, we also\nreport results for all conﬁgurations without using\nindomain data. Importantly, adding indomain data\nincreases the number of contexts for more than 90%\nof all rare words by at most 3, meaning that they\ncan still be considered rare despite the additional\nindomain contexts.\n\n[BERTRAM-_Improved_Word_Embeddings_Have_Big_Impact_on_Contextualized_Model_Performance p9]\n[0,125)\n[125,250)\n[250,500)\n[500,∞)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nWord counts\nAccuracy improvement\nBERT+BSL\nRoBERTa+BSL\nBERT+BSL+ID\nRoBERTa+BSL+ID\nFigure 4:\nImprovements for BERT (base) and\nRoBERTa (large) when adding BERTRAM-SLASH\n(+BSL) or BERTRAM-SLASH + INDOMAIN (+BSL+ID)\non MNLI-1000\nprevious rariﬁcation in two respects. First, we in-\ncrease the threshold for a word to count as rare\nfrom 100 to 1000. Second, as this means that we\nhave more WordNet synonyms available, we do not\nuse the misspelling dictionary (Piktus et al., 2019)\nfor substitution. We refer to the resulting datasets\nfor BERTbase and RoBERTalarge as MNLI-1000.\nFigure 4 shows results on MNLI-1000 for var-\nious rare word frequency ranges. For each value\n[c0, c1) on the x-axis, the y-axis shows improve-\nment in accuracy compared to standalone BERT\nor RoBERTa when only dataset entries are con-\nsidered for which each rariﬁed word occurs be-\ntween c0 (inclusively) and c1 (exclusively) times\nin WWC+BooksCorpus. We see that for words\nwith frequency less than 125, the improvement in\naccuracy remains similar even without using mis-\nspellings as another source of substitutions. In-\nterestingly, for every single interval of rare word\ncounts considered, adding BERTRAM-SLASH to\nBERT considerably improves its accuracy. For\nRoBERTa, adding BERTRAM brings improvements\nonly for words occurring less than 500 times.\nWhile using INDOMAIN data is beneﬁcial for\nrare words – simply because it gives us addi-\ntional contexts for these words –, when consid-\nering only words that occur at least 250 times in\nWWC+BookCorpus, adding INDOMAIN contexts\ndoes not help.\n6\nConclusion\nWe have introduced BERTRAM, a novel architec-\nture for inducing high-quality representations for\nrare words in BERT’s and RoBERTa’s embedding\nspaces. This is achieved by employing a powerful\npretrained language model and deeply integrating\nsurface-form and context information.

However, the re-\nsearch is still largely limited by the availability of\nlarge-scale high-quality dialogue data. Many cor-\npora have advanced the research of task-oriented\ndialogue systems, most of which are single do-\nmain conversations, including ATIS (Hemp\n\n[CrossWOZ-_A_Large-Scale_Chinese_Cross-Domain_Task-Oriented_Dialogue_Dataset p2]\nFigure 1: A dialogue example. The user state is ini-\ntialized by the user goal: ﬁnding an attraction and\none of its nearby hotels, then book a taxi to commute\nbetween these two places. In addition to expressing\npre-speciﬁed informable slots and ﬁlling in requestable\nslots, users need to consider and modify cross-domain\ninformable slots (bold) that vary through conversation.\nWe only show a few turns (turn number on the left),\neach with either user or system state of the current do-\nmain which are shown above each utterance.\nmain will affect the choices in related do-\nmains in CrossWOZ.

Those approaches typically suﬀer from the poor quality of the pattern\nrules, and the ranking process is used to identify relatively more precise at-\ntributes from all attribute candidates.\nAs for an already existing knowledge graph, there is plenty of work in litera-\nture dealing with ranking entities by relevance without or with a query. In [4], Li\net al. introduced the OntoRank algorithm for ranking the importance of seman-\ntic web objects at three levels of granularity: document, terms and RDF graphs.\nThe algorithm is based on the rational surfer model, successfully used in the\nSwoogle semantic web search engine. In [8], Hogan et al. presented an approach\nthat adapted the well-known PageRank/HITS algorithms to semantic web data,\nwhich took advantage of property values to rank entities. In [6,7], authors also\nfocused on ranking entities, sorting the semantic web resources based on impor-\ntance, relevance and query length, and aggregating the features together with\nan overall ranking model.\nJust a few works were designated to speciﬁcally address the problem of com-\nputing attribute rankings in a given Knowledge Graph. Ibminer [13] introduced\na tool for infobox(alias of an entity card) template suggestion, which collected\nattributes from diﬀerent sources and then sorted them by popularity based on\ntheir co-occurrences in the dataset. In [20], using the structured knowledge base,\nintermediate features were computed, including the importance or popularity\nof each entity type, IDF computation for each attribute on a global basis, IDF\ncomputation for entity types etc., and then the features were aggregated to\ntrain a classiﬁer.

By analyzing all results, we observe that semantic similarity based methods\nare more eﬀective than the previous method which we implemented based on\nTextRank. This conclusion is understandable because lots of enquiries do not\nsimply mention attribute words exactly, but some semantically related words\nare also used.\nEvaluating FastText, GloVe and word2vec, we show that compared to other\nword representation learning algorithms, the FastText performs best. We sample\nand analyze the category attributes and ﬁnd that many self-ﬁlled attributes\ncontain misspellings. The FastText algorithm represents words by a sum of its\ncharacter n-grams and it is much robust against problems like misspellings. In\nsummary, FastText has greater advantages in dealing with natural language\ncorpus usually with spelling mistakes.\nWe also applied the detected attributes in the automatic enquiry generation\ntask and we obtained signiﬁcantly better generated enquiries compared to previ-\nous rigid templates. Due to space limitation, we skip the explanation and leave\nit for future publications.\n4\nConclusions and Future work\nIn this paper, we proposed a new general method of identifying important at-\ntributes for entities from a knowledge graph. This is a relatively new task and\nour proposed method of using external textual data and performing semantic\nmatching via word/sub-word embeddings obtained better result compared to\nother work of using naive string matching and counting. In addition, we also\nsuccessfully applied the detected important attributes in our real world applica-\ntion of smart composing. In summary, the method is extensible to any knowl-\nedge graph without attribute importance information and outperforms previous\nmethod.\nIn future work, there are two major areas with potential of improving the\ndetection accuracy. The ﬁrst one is about sentence spli\n\n[Important_Attribute_Identification_in_Knowledge_Graph p2]\n2\n.\ngraph data, including entities, entities’ descriptions, entities’ attributes, and rela-\ntionship between entities. A full functional knowledge graph supporting general\npurposed reasoning and inference might still require long years of the commu-\nnity’s innovation and hardworking. On the other hand, many less demanding\napplications have great potential beneﬁting from the availability of information\nfrom the knowledge graph, such as query understanding and document under-\nstanding in information retrieval/search engines, simple inference in question\nanswering systems, and easy reasoning in domain-limited decision support tools.\nNot only academy, but also industry companies have been heavily investing in\nknowledge graphs, such as Google’s knowledge graph, Amazon’s product graph,\nFacebook’s Graph API, IBM’s Watson, and Microsoft’s Satori etc.\nIn the existing knowledge graph, such as Wikidata and DBpedia, usually\nattributes do not have order or priorities, and we don’t know which attributes\nare more important and of more interest to users. Such importance score of at-\ntributes is a vital piece of information in many applications of knowledge graph.\nThe most important application is the triggered entity card in search engine\nwhen a customer’s query gets hit for an entity. An entity usually has a large\namount of attributes, but an entity card has limited space and can only show\nthe most signiﬁcant information; attribute importance’s presence can make the\ndisplaying of an entity card easy to implement. Attribute importance also has\ngreat potential of playing a signiﬁcant role in search engine, how to decide the\nmatching score between the query and attribute values.

Moreover, this low dimensional space is able to capture lexical\nand semantic properties of words. Co-occurrence statistics are the fundamental\ninformation that allows creating such representations. Two approaches exist for\nbuilding word embeddings. One creates a low rank approximation of the word\nco-occurrence matrix, such as in the case of Latent Semantic Analysis [4] and\nGloVe [3]. The other approach consists in extracting internal representations\nfrom neural network models of text [2,5,6]. Levy and Goldberg [7] showed that\nthe two approaches are closely related.\nAlthough, word embeddings research go back several decades, it was the re-\ncent developments of Deep Learning and the word2vec framework [2] that cap-\ntured the attention of the NLP community. Moreover, Mikolov et al. [8] showed\nthat embeddings trained using word2vec models (CBOW and Skip-gram) exhibit\nlinear structure, allowing analogy questions of the form “man:woman::king:??.”\nand can boost performance of several text classiﬁcation tasks.\nOne of the issues of recent work in training word embeddings is the variability\nof experimental setups reported. For instance, in the paper describing GloVe\n[3] authors trained their model on ﬁve corpora of diﬀerent sizes and built a\nvocabulary of 400K most frequent words. Mikolov et al. [8] trained with 82K\nvocabulary while Mikolov et al. [2] was trained with 3M vocabulary. Recently,\nArora et al. [9] proposed a generative model for learning embeddings that tries\nto explain some theoretical justiﬁcation for nonlinear models (e.g. word2vec and\nGloVe) and some hyper parameter choices. Authors evaluated their model using\n68K vocabulary.\nSemEval 2016-Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter organizers report that\nparticipants either used general purpose pre-trained word embeddings, or trained\nfrom Tweet 2016 dat\n\n[Learning_Word_Embeddings_from_the_Portuguese_Twitter_Stream-_A_Study_of_some_Practical_Aspects p4]\nproduce embeddings that closely capture distributional similarity, so that words\nthat belong to the same semantic class, or which are synonyms and antonyms of\neach other, will be embedded in “close” regions of the embedding hyper-space.\nOur neural model is composed of the following layers:\n– a Input Word Embedding Layer, that maps each of the 4 input words\nrepresented by a 1-hot vectors with |V | dimensions (e.g. 32k) into a low\ndimension space (64 bits). The projections matrix - Winput - is shared across\nthe 4 inputs. This is not be the embedding matrix that we wish to produce.\n– a Merge Layer that concatenates the 4 previous embeddings into a sin-\ngle vector holding all the context information. The concatenation operation\nensures that the rest of the model has explicit information about the rela-\ntive position of the input words. Using an additive merge operation instead\nwould preserve information onlu about the presence of the words, not their\nsequence.\n– a Intermediate Context Embedding Dense Layer that maps the pre-\nceding representation of 4 words into a lower dimension space, still repre-\nsenting the entire context. We have ﬁxed this context representation to 64\ndimensions. This ultimately determines the dimension of the resulting em-\nbeddings.

Introduction\n\nCharacteristic metrics are a set of unsupervised measures that quantitatively describe or summarize the properties of a data collection. These metrics generally do not use ground-truth labels and only measure the intrinsic characteristics of data. The most prominent example is descriptive statistics that summarizes a data collection by a group of unsupervised measures such as mean or median for central tendency, variance or minimum-maximum for dispersion, skewness for symmetry, and kurtosis for heavy-tailed analysis.\n\nIn recent years, text classification, a category of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, has drawn much attention (Zhang et al., 2015; Joulin et al., 2016; Howard and Ruder, 2018) for its wide-ranging real-world applications such as fake news detection (Shu et al., 2017), document classification (Yang et al., 2016), and spoken language understanding (SLU) (Gupta et al., 2019a; Gupta et al., 2019b; Zhang et al., 2018), a core task of conversational assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.\n\nHowever, there are still insufficient characteristic metrics to describe a collection of texts. Unlike numeric or categorical data, simple descriptive statistics alone such as word counts and vocabulary size are difficult to capture the syntactic and semantic properties of a text collection.\n\nIn this work, we propose a set of characteristic metrics: diversity, density, and homogeneity to quantitatively summarize a collection of texts where the unit of texts could be a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. A text collection is first mapped into a high-dimensional embedding space. Our characteristic metrics are then computed to measure the dispersion, sparsity, and uniformity of the distribution. Based on the choice of embedding methods, these characteristic metrics can help understand the properties of a text collection from different linguistic perspectives, for example,\n\n1These authors contributed equally.\n*Work done as a Principal Scientist at AWS AI.\n\nLexical diversity, syntactic variation, and semantic homogeneity. Our proposed diversity, density, and homogeneity metrics extract hard-to-visualize quantitative insight for a better understanding and comparison between text collections.\n\nTo verify the effectiveness of proposed characteristic metrics, we first conduct a series of simulation experiments that cover various scenarios in two-dimensional as well as high-dimensional vector spaces. The results show that our proposed quantitative characteristic metrics exhibit several desirable and intuitive properties such as robustness and linear sensitivity of the diversity metric with respect to random down-sampling. Besides, we investigate the relationship between the characteristic metrics and the performance of a renowned model, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), on the text classification task using two public benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that there are high correlations between text classification model performance and the characteristic metrics, which shows the efficacy of our proposed metrics.\n\n2. Related Work\n\nA building block of characteristic metrics for text collections is the language representation method. A classic way to represent a sentence or a paragraph is n-gram, with dimension equals to the size of vocabulary. More advanced methods learn a relatively low dimensional latent space that represents each word or token as a continuous semantic vector such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), and fastText (Mikolov et al., 2017). These methods have been widely adopted with consistent performance improvements on many NLP tasks. Also, there has been extensive research on representing a whole sentence as a vector such as a plain or weighted average of word vectors (Arora et al., 2016), skip-thought vectors (Kiros et al., 2015), and self-attentive sentence enc", "prediction_text_plus_vision": "Yes, they proposed the diversity, density and homogeneity metrics.", "retrieved_text": [{"doc_id": "Diversity__Density__and_Homogeneity-_Quantitative_Characteristic_Metrics_for_Text_Collections", "page": 1}, {"doc_id": "Diversity__Density__and_Homogeneity-_Quantitative_Characteristic_Metrics_for_Text_Collections", "page": 2}, {"doc_id": "Classification_Betters_Regression_in_Query-based_Multi-document_Summarisation_Techniques_for_Questio", "page": 9}], "retrieved_vision": [{"doc_id": "Diversity__Density__and_Homogeneity-_Quantitative_Characteristic_Metrics_for_Text_Collections", "page": 1}], "vision_tokens_paths": ["/home/xwh/VisRAG/output_reindex_1536/vision_tokens/Diversity__Density__and_Homogeneity-_Quantitative_Characteristic_Metrics_for_Text_Collections/page_1.pt"]}

Un-\nderstanding and reasoning about procedural texts\n(e.g. cooking recipes, how-to guides, scientiﬁc pro-\ncesses) are very hard for machines as it demands\nmodeling the intrinsic dynamics of the procedures\n(Bosselut et al., 2018; Dalvi et al., 2018; Yagcioglu\net al., 2018). That is, one must be aware of the\nentities present in the text, infer relations among\nthem and even anticipate changes in the states of\nthe entities after each action.

The ﬁgure shows that\ncountries in North America are likely to speak about Topic 7\nleast.\nThe analysis of discussion of international development\nin annual UN General Debate statements therefore uncovers\ntwo principle development topics: economic development and\nsustainable development. We ﬁnd that discussion of Topic\n2 is not signiﬁcantly impacted by country-speciﬁc factors,\nsuch as wealth, population, democracy, levels of ODA, and\nconﬂict (although there are regional effects). However, we\nﬁnd that the extent to which countries discuss sustainable\ndevelopment (Topic 7) in their annual GD statements varies\nconsiderably according to these different structural factors.\nThe results suggest that broadly-speaking we do not observe\nlinear trends in the relationship between these country-speciﬁc\nfactors and discussion of Topic 7. Instead, we ﬁnd that there\nare signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the relationship between factors\nsuch as wealth, democracy, etc., and the extent to which these\nstates discuss sustainable development in their GD statements.\nThese relationships require further analysis and exploration.\nIII.

However, we\nﬁnd that the extent to which countries discuss sustainable\ndevelopment (Topic 7) in their annual GD statements varies\nconsiderably according to these different structural factors.\nThe results suggest that broadly-speaking we do not observe\nlinear trends in the relationship between these country-speciﬁc\nfactors and discussion of Topic 7. Instead, we ﬁnd that there\nare signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the relationship between factors\nsuch as wealth, democracy, etc., and the extent to which these\nstates discuss sustainable development in their GD statements.\nThese relationships require further analysis and exploration.\nIII.

Scatterplots of ROUGE SU4 evaluation metrics against the average human\nevaluations.\n8\nConclusions\nMacquarie University’s participation in BioASQ 7 focused on the task of generat-\ning the ideal answers. The runs use query-based extractive techniques and we ex-\nperiment with classiﬁcation, regression, and reinforcement learning approaches.\nAt the time of writing there were no human evaluation results, and based on\nROUGE-F1 scores under cross-validation on the training data we observed that\nclassiﬁcation approaches outperform regression approaches. We experimented\nwith several approaches to label the individual sentences for the classiﬁer and\nobserved that the optimal labelling policy for this task diﬀered from prior work.\nWe also observed poor correlation between ROUGE-Recall and human eval-\nuation metrics and suggest to use alternative automatic evaluation metrics with\nbetter correlation, such as ROUGE-Precision or ROUGE-F1. Given the nature\nof precision-based metrics which could bias the system towards returning short\nsummaries, ROUGE-F1 is probably more appropriate when using at develop-\nment time, for example for the reward function used by a reinforcement learning\nsystem.\nReinforcement learning gives promising results, especially in human evalua-\ntions made on the runs submitted to BioASQ 6b. This year we introduced very\nsmall changes to the runs using reinforcement learning, and will aim to explore\nmore complex reinforcement learning strategies and more complex neural models\nin the policy and value estimators.\n\n[Classification_Betters_Regression_in_Query-based_Multi-document_Summarisation_Techniques_for_Questio p9]\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n9\nonly considers pairs of variable values within the same set.

Overall, ROUGE-2 and\nROUGE-SU4 give similar correlation values but ROUGE-SU4 is marginally bet-\nter. Among precision, recall and F1, both precision and F1 are similar, but pre-\ncision gives a better correlation. Recall shows poor correlation, and virtually no\ncorrelation when using the revised Kendall measure. For reporting the evalua-\ntion of results, it will be therefore more useful to use precision or F1. However,\ngiven the small diﬀerence between precision and F1, and given that precision\nmay favour short summaries when used as a function to optimise in a machine\nlearning setting (e.g. using reinforcement learning), it may be best to use F1 as\nthe metric to optimise.\nTable 6.

The table\nuses ROUGE-SU4 Recall since this is the metric available at the time of writing\nthis paper.

Semantically conditioned LSTM-based\nnatural language generation for spoken dialogue\nsystems. In Proceedings of the 2015 Confer-\ne\n\n[CrossWOZ-_A_Large-Scale_Chinese_Cross-Domain_Task-Oriented_Dialogue_Dataset p2]\nFigure 1: A dialogue example. The user state is ini-\ntialized by the user goal: ﬁnding an attraction and\none of its nearby hotels, then book a taxi to commute\nbetween these two places. In addition to expressing\npre-speciﬁed informable slots and ﬁlling in requestable\nslots, users need to consider and modify cross-domain\ninformable slots (bold) that vary through conversation.\nWe only show a few turns (turn number on the left),\neach with either user or system state of the current do-\nmain which are shown above each utterance.\nmain will affect the choices in related do-\nmains in CrossWOZ. As shown in Figure 1\nand Table 2, the hotel must be near the at-\ntraction chosen by the user in previous turns,\nwhich requires more accurate context under-\nstanding.\n2. It is the ﬁrst Chinese corpus that contains\nlarge-scale multi-domain task-oriented dia-\nlogues, consisting of 6K sessions and 102K\nutterances for 5 domains (attraction, restau-\nrant, hotel, metro, and taxi).\n3. Annotation of dialogue states and dialogue\nacts is provided for both the system side and\nuser side. The annotation of user states en-\nables us to track the conversation from the\nuser’s perspective and can empower the de-\nvelopment of more elaborate user simulators.\nIn this paper, we present the process of dialogue\ncollection and provide detailed data analysis of the\ncorpus. Statistics show that our cross-domain dia-\nlogues are complicated. To facilitate model com-\nparison, benchmark models are provided for dif-\nferent modules in pipelined task-oriented dialogue\nsystems, including natural language understand-\ning, dialogue state tracking, dialogue policy learn-\ning, and natural language generation. We also pro-\nvide a user simulator, which will facilitate the de-\nvelopme", "prediction_text_only": "The conversation layer is responsible for managing the flow of the conversation between the user and the system.

These bots help reduce traffic received by human support\nsignificantly by handling frequent and directly answerable known\nquestions. Many such services have huge reference documents such\nas FAQ pages, which makes it hard for users to browse through this\ndata. A conversation layer over such raw data can lower traffic to\nhuman support by a great margin. We demonstrate QnAMaker, a\nservice that creates a conversational layer over semi-structured data\nsuch as FAQ pages, product manuals, and support documents. QnA-\nMaker is the popular choice for Extraction and Question-Answering\nas a service and is used by over 15,000 bots in production. It is also\nused by search interfaces and not just bots.\nKEYWORDS\nChatBots, Democratizing AI, Question Answering\n\n[QnAMaker-_Data_to_Bot_in_2_Minutes p3]\nQnAMaker: Data to Bot in 2 Minutes\nWWW ’20 Companion, April 20–24, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan\nDomain\nNumber of QAs\nAvg Questions per QA\nAUC (%)\nF1\n(top answer)\nNavigation Help Bot\n56\n12.5\n88.7\n71.2\nChit-Chat Alone\n100\n9.8\n92.4\n88.6\nCustomerCare Interface\n164\n2.2\n90.9\n86.7\nHR Internal Bot\n52\n1.0\n85.5\n82.6\nHR Internal Bot (with Chit-Chat)\n152\n6.78\n82.7\n77.6\nTable 1: Retrieval And Ranking Measurements\nPre-\nProcessing\nWordNet \nFeatures\nRanking\nTF-IDF\nDSSM\nFeatures\nFeaturization\nSearch \nQuery\nFormulation\nAzure Search \nIndex\nQnAMaker WebApp\nBot API Call\nEnd-User \nQuery\nRanked \nCandidates\nFigure 2: QnAMaker Runtime Pipeline\nanswer.

This section describes a correlation\nanalysis between human and ROUGE evaluations using the runs of all partici-\npants to all previous BioASQ challenges that included human evaluations (Phase\nB, ideal answers). The human evaluation results were scraped from the BioASQ\nResults page, and the ROUGE results were kindly provided by the organisers.\nWe compute the correlation of each of the ROUGE metrics (recall, precision,\nF1 for ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4) against the average of the human scores.\nThe correlation metrics are Pearson, Kendall, and a revised Kendall correlation\nexplained below.\nThe Pearson correlation between two variables is computed as the covariance\nof the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. This\ncorrelation is a good indication of a linear relation between the two variables,\nbut may not be very eﬀective when there is non-linear correlation.\nThe Spearman rank correlation and the Kendall rank correlation are two\nof the most popular among metrics that aim to detect non-linear correlations.\nThe Spearman rank correlation between two variables can be computed as the\nPearson\n\n[Classification_Betters_Regression_in_Query-based_Multi-document_Summarisation_Techniques_for_Questio p9]\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n9\nonly considers pairs of variable values within the same set.

Overall, ROUGE-2 and\nROUGE-SU4 give similar correlation values but ROUGE-SU4 is marginally bet-\nter. Among precision, recall and F1, both precision and F1 are similar, but pre-\ncision gives a better correlation. Recall shows poor correlation, and virtually no\ncorrelation when using the revised Kendall measure. For reporting the evalua-\ntion of results, it will be therefore more useful to use precision or F1. However,\ngiven the small diﬀerence between precision and F1, and given that precision\nmay favour short summaries when used as a function to optimise in a machine\nlearning setting (e.g. using reinforcement learning), it may be best to use F1 as\nthe metric to optimise.\nTable 6.

This makes systematic experimentation of alternative word-\nembedding conﬁgurations extremely diﬃcult.\nIn this work, we make progress in trying to ﬁnd good combinations of some\nof the previous parameters. We focus speciﬁcally in the task of computing word\nembeddings for processing the Portuguese Twitter stream. User-generated con-\ntent (such as twitter messages) tends to be populated by words that are speciﬁc\nto the medium, and that are constantly being added by users. These dynamics\npose challenges to NLP systems, which have diﬃculties in dealing with out of\nvocabulary words. Therefore, learning a semantic representation for those words\ndirectly from the user-generated stream - and as the words arise - would allow\nus to keep up with the dynamics of the medium and reduce the cases for which\nwe have no information about the words.\nStarting from our own implementation of a neural word embedding model,\nwhich should be seen as a ﬂexible baseline model for further experimentation,\nour research tries to answer the following practical questions:\n– how large is the vocabulary the one can realistically embed given the level\nof resources that most organizations can aﬀord to buy and to manage (as\nopposed to large clusters of GPU’s only available to a few organizations)?\n– how much data, as a function of the size of the vocabulary we wish to embed,\nis enough for training meaningful embeddings?\n– how can we evaluate embedding", "prediction_text_only": "We perform experiments with large-scale features in the case of 768-dimensional space.

The NLU module usually\nuses the ﬁrst best interpretation of a given speech in down-\nstream tasks such as domain and intent classiﬁcation. How-\never, the ASR module might misrecognize some speeches\nand the ﬁrst best interpretation could be erroneous and noisy.\nSolely relying on the ﬁrst best interpretation could make the\nperformance of downstream tasks non-optimal. To address\nthis issue, we introduce a series of simple yet efﬁcient mod-\nels for improving the understanding of semantics of the input\nspeeches by collectively exploiting the n-best speech inter-\npretations from the ASR module.\nIndex Terms— ASR n-best hypotheses integration, spo-\nken language understanding\n1. INTRODUCTION\nCurrently, voice-controlled smart devices are widely used in\nmultiple areas to fulﬁll various tasks, e.g. playing music, ac-\nquiring weather information and booking tickets. The SLU\nsystem employs several modules to enable the understanding\nof the semantics of the input speeches. When there is an in-\ncoming speech, the ASR module picks it up and attempts to\ntranscribe the speech. An ASR model could generate mul-\ntiple interpretations for most speeches, which can be ranked\nby their associated conﬁdence scores. Among the n-best hy-\npotheses, the top-1 hypothesis is usually transformed to the\nNLU module for downstream tasks such as domain classiﬁ-\ncation, intent classiﬁcation and named entity recognition (slot\ntagging). Multi-domain NLU modules are usually designed\nhierarchically [1]. For one incoming utterance, NLU mod-\nules will ﬁrstly classify the uttera\n\n[Improving_Spoken_Language_Understanding_By_Exploiting_ASR_N-best_Hypotheses p4]\nTable 5: Performance comparison for the subset (∼81%)\nwhere ASR ﬁrst best agrees with transcription.\nCategory\nModel\nRErr(%)\nBaseline\n0.00\nIntegration\nPoolingAvg\n3.56\nPoolingMax\n-0.38\nCombined Sentence\n4.50\nDirect\nSort by Score\n-8.269\nMajority Vote\n-3.19\nRerank (Oracle)\n0.00\nOracle\n0.00\nwith the transcription. When ASR 1st best agrees with tran-\nscription, the proposed integration models can also keep the\nperformance. Under that condition, we can still improve a lit-\ntle (3.56%) because, by introducing multiple ASR hypothe-\nses, we could have more information and when the transcrip-\ntion/ASR 1st best does not appear in the training set’s tran-\nscriptions, its n-bests list may have similar hypotheses in-\ncluded in the training set’s n-bests.\nThen, our integration\nmodel trained on n-best hypotheses as well has clue to pre-\ndict. The series of comparisons reveal that our approaches\nintegrating the hypotheses are robust to the ASR errors and\nwhenever the ASR model makes mistakes, we can outperform\nmore signiﬁcantly.\n4.4.

Let r = (r1, r2 . . . rN) be N horses\nwith a probability distribution P on their abilities to win a game, and a rank π = (π(1), π(2) . . . π(|π|)) of horses can\nbe understood as a generative procedure, where π(j) denotes the index of the horse in the jth position.\nIn the 1st position, there are N horses as candidates, each of which rj has a probability p(rj) to be selected. Regarding\nthe rank π, the probability of generating the champion is p(rπ(1)). Then the horse rπ(1) is removed from the candidate\npool.\nIn the 2nd position, there are only N −1 horses, and their probabilities to be selected become p(rj)/Z2, where\nZ2 = 1 −p(rπ(1)) is the normalization. Then the runner-up in the rank π, the π(2)th horse, is chosen at the probability\np(rπ(2))/Z2. We use a consistent terminology Z1 in selecting the champion, though Z1 equals 1 trivially.\nThis procedure iterates to the last rank in π. The key idea for the Plackett-Luce model is the choice in the ith position in\na rank π only depends on the candidates not chosen at previous stages. The probability of generating a rank π is given\nas follows\np(π) =\n|π|\nY\nj=1\np(rπ(j))\nZj\n(1)\nwhere Zj = 1 −Pj−1\nt=1 p(rπ(t)).\nWe offer a toy example (Table 1) to demonstrate this procedure.\nr\nr1\nr2\nr3\nπ\n2\n3\n1\nZ\n1\n1-p(r2)\n1-(p(r2) + p(r3))\np(π)\np(r2)\nZ1\np(r3)\nZ2\np(r1)\nZ3\nTable 1: The probability of the rank π = (2, 3, 1) is p(r2) · p(r3)/(1 −p(r2)) in a simpliﬁed form, as p(r2)\nZ1\n= p(r2)\nand p(r1)\nZ3\n= 1.\nTheorem 1. The permutation probabilities p(π) form a probability distribution over a set of permutations Ωπ. For\nexample, for each π ∈Ωπ, we have p(π) > 0, and P\nπ∈Ωπ p(π) = 1.\nWe have to note that, Ωπ is not necessarily required to be completely ranked permutations in theory and in practice,\nsince gamblers might be interested in only the champi\n\n[Learning_Supervised_Topic_Models_for_Classification_and_Regression_from_Crowds p6]\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL.

Recall shows poor correlation, and virtually no\ncorrelation when using the revised Kendall measure. For reporting the evalua-\ntion of results, it will be therefore more useful to use precision or F1. However,\ngiven the small diﬀerence between precision and F1, and given that precision\nmay favour short summaries when used as a function to optimise in a machine\nlearning setting (e.g. using reinforcement learning), it may be best to use F1 as\nthe metric to optimise.\nTable 6.

Moreover, the corpus\ncontains rich annotation of dialogue states\nand dialogue acts at both user and system\nsides.\nAbout 60% of the dialogues have\ncross-domain user goals that favor inter-\ndomain dependency and encourage natural\ntransition across domains in conversation.\nWe also provide a user simulator and sev-\neral benchmark models for pipelined task-\noriented dialogue systems, which will fa-\ncilitate researchers to compare and evaluate\ntheir models on this corpus. The large size\nand rich annotation of CrossWOZ make it\nsuitable to investigate a variety of tasks in\ncross-domain dialogue modeling, such as\ndialogue state tracking, policy learning, user\nsimulation, etc.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecently, there have been a variety of task-\noriented dialogue models thanks to the prosper-\nity of neural architectures (Yao et al., 2013; Wen\net al., 2015; Mrkši´c et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2017;\nLei et al., 2018; Gür et al., 2018).

However, as\nnatural language processing methods ﬂourish, there are still insufﬁcient characteristic metrics to describe a collection of texts in terms\nof the words, sentences, or paragraphs they comprise. In this work, we propose metrics of diversity, density, and homogeneity that\nquantitatively measure the dispersion, sparsity, and uniformity of a text collection. We conduct a series of simulations to verify that each\nmetric holds desired properties and resonates with human intuitions. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed\ncharacteristic metrics are highly correlated with text classiﬁcation performance of a renowned model, BERT, which could inspire future\napplications.\nKeywords: diversity, density, homogeneity, characteristics, text classiﬁcation, quantitative measures\n1.\nIntroduction\nCharacteristic metrics are a set of unsupervised measures\nthat quantitatively describe or summarize the properties of a\ndata collection. These metrics generally do not use ground-\ntruth labels and only measure the intrinsic characteristics\nof data. The most prominent example is descriptive statis-\ntics that summarizes a data collection by a group of un-\nsupervised measures such as mean or median for central\ntendency, variance or minimum-maximum for dispersion,\nskewness for symmetry, and kurtosis for heavy-tailed anal-\nysis.\nIn recent years, text classiﬁcation, a category of Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks, has drawn much at-\ntention (Zhang et al., 2015; Joulin et al., 2016; Howard\nand Ruder, 2018) for its wide-ranging real-world applica-\ntions such as fake news detection (Shu et al.,\n\n[Learning_Word_Embeddings_from_the_Portuguese_Twitter_Stream-_A_Study_of_some_Practical_Aspects p6]\nTable 1.

The number of examples collected for\neach of the values of |V | is shown in Table 1.\nSince one of the goals of our experiments is to understand the impact of using\ndiﬀerent amounts of training data, for each size of vocabulary to be embedded\n|V | we will run experiments training the models using 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%\nof the data available.\n4.2\nMetrics related with the Learning Process\nWe tracked metrics related to the learning process itself, as a function of the\nvocabulary size to be embedded |V | and of the fraction of training data used\n(25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). For all possible conﬁgurations, we recorded the val-\nues of the training and validation loss (cross entropy) after each epoch. Tracking\nthese metrics serves as a minimalistic sanity check: if the model is not able to\nsolve the word prediction task with some degree of success (e.g. if we observe no\nsubstantial decay in the losses) then one should not expect the embeddings to\ncapture any of the distributional information they are supposed to capture.\n4.3\nTests and Gold-Standard Data for Intrinsic Evaluation\nUsing the gold standard data (described below), we performed three types of\ntests:\n– Class Membership Tests: embeddings corresponding two member of the\nsame semantic class (e.g. “Months of the Year”, “Portuguese Cities”, “Smi-\nleys”) should be close, since they are supposed to be found in mostly the\nsame contexts.\n– Class Distinction Test: this is the reciprocal of the previous Class Mem-\nbership test. Embeddings of elements of diﬀerent classes should be diﬀerent,\nsince words of diﬀerent classes ere expected to be found in signiﬁcantly dif-\nferent contexts.\n– Word Equivalence Test: embeddings corresponding to synonyms, antonyms,\nabbreviations (e.g. “porque” abbreviated by “pq”) and partial references\n(e.g.\n\n[Diversity__Density__and_Homogeneity-_Quantitative_Characteristic_Metrics_for_Text_Collections p2]\nMore recently, there is a paradigm shift from non-\ncontextualized word embeddings to self-supervised lan-\nguage model (LM) pretraining. Language encoders are pre-\ntrained on a large text corpus using a LM-based objective\nand then re-used for other NLP tasks in a transfer learn-\ning manner.\nThese methods can produce contextualized\nword representations, which have proven to be effective\nfor signiﬁcantly improving many NLP tasks. Among the\nmost popular approaches are ULMFiT (Howard and Ruder,\n2018), ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT (Radford\net al., 2018), and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). In this work,\nwe adopt BERT, a transformer-based technique for NLP\npretraining, as the backbone to embed a sentence or a para-\ngraph into a representation vector.\nAnother stream of related works is the evaluation met-\nrics for cluster analysis.\nAs measuring property or\nquality of outputs from a clustering algorithm is dif-\nﬁcult, human judgment with cluster visualization tools\n(Kwon et al., 2017;\nKessler, 2017) are often used.\nThere are unsupervised metrics to measure the quality of\na clustering result such as the Calinski-Harabasz score\n(Cali´nski and Harabasz, 1974), the Davies-Bouldin index\n(Davies and Bouldin, 1979), and the Silhouette coefﬁcients\n(Rousseeuw, 1987). Complementary to these works that\nmodel cross-cluster similarities or relationships, our pro-\nposed diversity, density and homogeneity metrics focus on\nthe characteristics of each single cluster, i.e., intra cluster\nrather than inter cluster relationships.\n3.\nProposed Characteristic Metrics\nWe introduce our proposed diversity, density, and homo-\ngeneity metrics with their detailed formulations and key in-\ntuitions.\nOur ", "prediction_text_only": "Yes, we have proposed a set of metrics that can be used to track the progress of a model during training.

When using 100% we see no model overﬁtting. We can also observe that\nthe higher is |V | the higher are the absolute values of the loss sets.

Finally, when not overﬁtting, the validation\nloss seems to stabilize after around 20 epochs.

Experiments with large-scale features demonstrate\nthat, the new method is more robust than MERT; though it is only matchable with MIRAs, it has a\ncomparatively advantage, easier to implement.\n1\nIntroduction\nSince Och [26] proposed minimum error rate training (MERT) to exactly optimize objective evaluation measures,\nMERT has become a standard model tuning technique in statistical machine translation (SMT). Though MERT performs\nbetter by improving its searching algorithm [23, 6, 13, 25], it does not work reasonably when there are lots of features1.\nAs a result, margin infused relaxed algorithms (MIRA) dominate in this case [24, 35, 10, 31, 7].\nIn SMT, MIRAs consider margin losses related to sentence-level BLEUs. However, since the BLEU is not decomposable\ninto each sentence, these MIRA algorithms use some heuristics to compute the exact losses, e.g., pseudo-document\n[10], and document-level loss [31].\nRecently, another successful work in large-scale feature tuning include force decoding based[36], classiﬁcation based\n[15].\nWe aim to provide a s", "prediction_text_only": "Yes, this is true.", "prediction_vision_only": "The results suggest that using less than 50% of the available training examples might result in overfitting.

Moreover, the corpus\ncontains rich annotation of dialogue states\nand dialogue acts at both user and system\nsides.\nAbout 60% of the dialogues have\ncross-domain user goals that favor inter-\ndomain dependency and encourage natural\ntransition across domains in conversation.\nWe also provide a user simulator and sev-\neral benchmark models for pipelined task-\noriented dialogue systems, which will fa-\ncilitate researchers to compare and evaluate\ntheir models on this corpus.

Although these unsupervised methods can capture many strong words, \ntheir performance is often not high enough for the practical use. \nSupervised methods, such as HMM tagging (Xue, 2003), character-based classification (Wang et \nal., 2008) and morpheme-based lexical chunking (Fu et al., 2008), attempt to acquire a model \nbased on a dictionary or a labelled data set. Among them, character-based classification has \ndrawn most attention recently and been further implemented with sequence labelling algorithms \n(Tseng et al., 2005), e.g., conditional random fields (CRF), which perform well in both in-\nvocabulary (IV) recall and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) recall. Based on the character labelling ap-\nproach, many related studies make efforts to improve the performance by various means, such as \nusing more tags and features (Tang  et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2006), employing word-based tag-\nging without tagging (Zhang and Clark, 2007), employing some joint models that combines a \ngenerative model and a discriminative model (Wang et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011) or Markov \nand semi-Markov CRF (Andrew, 2006), and integrating unsupervised segmentation features \n(Zhao and Kit, 2011). \nAlthough there are various studies CWS individually, there are few studies of active learning on \nCWS. One related work is about active learning on Japanese word segmenta\n\n[Active_Learning_for_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_in_Medical_Text p6]\nDuring training, we go through all the boundaries in the unlabeled data only once and the fre-\nquency of the surrounding bigram is updated serially as: \n1\n1\nk\nk\nc c\nf\n+ + =  \nWhere \n1\nk\nk\nc c + is the surrounding character bigram of current boundary\nkI . Meanwhile, the diver-\nsity of boundary \nkI  can be measured exactly by the frequency of its surrounding bigram: \n1\n(\n)\nk k\nDiv\nk\nc c\nI\nf\nφ\n+\n=\n \nIt is worth mentioning that above diversity measure is a dynamic one. It is possible that two \nboundaries with the same character bigram context, e.g., \n1\nA\nI\n and \n1\nBI\n in the above examples, are \nassigned with different diversity values during training. Specifically, the boundary with a first \nappearing bigram has the lowest diversity value while the boundaries appearing afterwards have \nhigher values and thus are not likely to be picked as the top informative ones. In this way, the \nduplicate-annotated words can be avoided to some extent. \nIn summary, uncertainty sampling with diversity (in short, uncertainty-diversity sampling) ranks \nthe boundaries according to the following formula: \n_\n(\n)\n(\n)\n(\n)\nUn\nDiv\nUn\nDiv\nk\nk\nk\nI\nI\nI\nφ\nφ\nφ\n=\n⋅\n \nThe lower the value is, the more informative the boundary is thought to be. Obviously, uncer-\ntainty-diversity sampling requires only O(N) in computational complexity. \nTherefore, active learning on CWS can be implemented in the following two ways: Uncertainty \nsampling: In each iteration, all the instances in the unlabeled data U are ranked according to their \nuncertainty values and top instances are selected for oracle labelling; Uncertainty-Diversity \nsampling: In each iteration, all the instances in the unlabeled data U are ranked according to their \nuncertainty-diversity values and top instances are selected for oracle labeling.  \n4 \nExperimentation \n4.1 \nExperimental Setting \nThe SIGHAN Bakeoff 2 dataset consists of four different corpora: PKU, MSR, CityU, and AS. \nBut we only report the performance on three of the corpora except\n\n[Learning_Supervised_Topic_Models_for_Classification_and_Regression_from_Crowds p2]\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL.

We propose two different models, one for\nclassiﬁcation [13] and another for regression problems, thus\ncovering a very wide range of possible practical applica-\ntions, as we empirically demonstrate. Since the majority of\nthe tasks for which multiple annotators are used generally\ninvolve complex data such as text, images and video, by\ndeveloping a multi-annotator supervised topic model we\nare contributing with a powerful tool for learning predictive\nmodels of complex high-dimensional data from crowds.\nGiven that the increasing sizes of modern datasets can\npose a problem for obtaining human labels as well as\nfor Bayesian inference, we propose an efﬁcient stochastic\nvariational inference algorithm [14] that is able to scale\nto very large datasets. We empirically show, using both\nsimulated and real multiple-annotator labels obtained from\nAMT for popular text and image collections, that the pro-\nposed models are able to outperform other state-of-the-art\napproaches in both classiﬁcation and regression tasks.

InScript is a corpus of 1,000 stories centered\naround 10 different scenarios. Verbs and noun phrases are annotated with event and participant types, respectively. Additionally, the text\nis annotated with coreference information. The corpus shows rich lexical variation and will serve as a unique resource for the study of\nthe role of script knowledge in natural language processing.\nKeywords: scripts, narrative texts, script knowledge, common sense knowledge\n1.\nMotivation\nA script is “a standardized sequence of events that describes\nsome stereotypical human activity such as going to a restau-\nrant or visiting a doctor” (Barr and Feigenbaum, 1981).\nScript events describe an action/activity along with the in-\nvolved participants. For example, in the script describing\nA VISIT TO A RESTAURANT, typical events are ENTERING\nTHE RESTAURANT, ORDERING FOOD or EATING. Partici-\npants in this scenario can include animate objects like the\nWAITER and the CUSTOMER, as well as inanimate objects\nsuch as CUTLERY or FOOD.\nScript knowledge has been shown to play an important role\nin text understanding (Cullingford (1978), Miikkulainen\n(1995), Mueller (2004), Chambers and Jurafsky (2008),\nChambers and Jurafsky (2009), Modi and Titov (2014),\nRudinger et al. (2015)). It guides the expectation of the\nreader, supports coreference resolution as well as common-\nsense knowledge inference and enables the appropriate em-\nbedding of the current sentence into the larger context. Fig-\nure 1 shows the ﬁrst few sentences of a story describing\nthe scenario TAKING A BATH.

However, the difference in the variation of\nlexical variance of scenarios is larger for DeScript than for\nInScript. Thus, the properties of a scenario apparently in-\nﬂuence the lexical variance of the event descriptions more\nthan the variance of the narrative texts.\nWe used entropy (Shannon, 1948) over lemmas to measure\nthe variance of lexical realizations for events. We excluded\nevents for which there were less than 10 occurrences in De-\nScript or InScript. Since there is only an event annotation\nfor 50 ESDs per scenario in DeScript, we randomly sam-\npled 50 texts from InScript for computing the entropy to\nmake the numbers more comparable.\ncheck_time-table\nget_train_station\nget_tickets\nget_platform\nwait\nget_on\nfind_place\nconductor_checks\nspend_time_train\narrive_destination\nget_off\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nN(DeScript)\nN(InScript)\nH(DeScript)\nH(inScript)\nFigure 11: Entropy over verb lemmas for events (left y-axis, H(x))\nin the GOING ON A TRAIN SCENARIO.

As can\nbe seen in the graph, the entropy for InScript is in general\nhigher than for DeScript. In the stories, a wider variety of\nverbs is used to describe events. There are also large dif-\nferences between events: While WAIT has a really low en-\ntropy, SPEND TIME TRAIN has an extremely high entropy\nvalue. This event type covers many different activities such\nas reading, sleeping etc.\n5.\nConclusion\nIn this paper we described the InScript corpus of 1,000 nar-\nrative texts annotated with script structure and coreference\ninformation.

However,\nthe need to model the relationship between documents and\nlabels quickly gave rise to many supervised variants of\nLDA. One of the ﬁrst notable works was that of supervised\nLDA (sLDA) [7].

We deﬁne inﬂuence of an observed fact\non the prediction as the change in the prediction\nscore if the observed fact was not present when\nthe embeddings were learned. Previous work have\nused this concept of inﬂuence similarly for sev-\neral different tasks [Kononenko et al., 2010, Koh\nand Liang, 2017]. Formally, for the target triple\n⟨s, r, o⟩and observed graph G, we want to identify\na neighboring triple ⟨s′, r′, o⟩∈G such that the\nscore ψ(s, r, o) when trained on G and the score\nψ(s, r, o) when trained on G−{⟨s′, r′, o⟩} are max-\nimally different, i.e.\nargmax\n(s′,r′)∈Nei(o)\n∆(s′,r′)(s, r, o)\n(2)\nwhere ∆(s′,r′)(s, r, o) = ψ(s, r, o)−ψ(s, r, o), and\nNei(o) = {(s′, r′)|⟨s′, r′, o⟩∈G}.\n3.2\nAdding a new fact (CRIAGE-Add)\nWe are also interested in investigating the robust-\nness of models, i.e., how sensitive are the predic-\ntions to small additions to the knowledge graph.\nSpeciﬁcally, for a target prediction ⟨s, r, o⟩, we\nare interested in identifying a single fake fact\n⟨s′, r′, o⟩that, when added to the knowledge graph\nG, changes the prediction score ψ(s, r, o) the most.\nUsing ψ(s, r, o) as the score after training on\nG ∪{⟨s′, r′, o⟩}, we deﬁne the adversary as:\nargmax\n(s′,r′)\n∆(s′,r′)(s, r, o)\n(3)\nwhere ∆(s′,r′)(s, r, o) = ψ(s, r, o) −ψ(s, r, o)\n\n[Investigating_Robustness_and_Interpretability_of_Link_Prediction_via_Adversarial_Modifications p2]\nFerdinand\nMaria\nPrincess\nHenriette\nViolante\nBavaria\nisMarried\nhasChild\nhasChild\ntarget prediction\n⟨s, r, o⟩\n(a) KG, with the target prediction\nFerdinand\nMaria\nPrincess\nHenriette\nViolante\nBavaria\nA.S.D.\nAstrea\nisMarried\nhasChild\n⟨s′, r′, o⟩\nremoved\nhasChild\n(b) After removing a fact\nFerdinand\nMaria\nPrincess\nHenriette\nViolante\nBavaria\nNew\nYork\nAl Jazira\nClub\nisMarried\nhasChild\nplaysFor\n⟨s′, r′, o⟩\nadded\nhasChild\n(c) After adding a fact\nFigure 1: Completion Robustness and Interpretability via Adversarial Graph Edits (CRIAGE): Change in\nthe graph structure that changes the prediction of the retrained model, where (a) is the original sub-graph of the\nKG, (b) removes a neighboring link of the target, resulting in a change in the prediction, and (c) shows the effect\nof adding an attack triple on the target.

To ﬁnd\nthese minimal changes for a target link, we need to\nidentify the fact that, when added into or removed\nfrom the graph, will have the biggest impact on the\npredicted score of the target fact. Unfortunately,\ncomputing this change in the score is expensive\nsince it involves retraining the model to recompute\nthe embeddings. We propose an efﬁcient estimate\nof this score change by approximating the change\nin the embeddings using Taylor expansion.

The model proposed in this article for\nclassiﬁcation problems shares the same intuition with this\nline of work and models the true labels as latent variables.\nHowever, it differs signiﬁcantly by using a fully Bayesian\napproach for estimating the reliabilities and biases of the\ndifferent annotators. Furthermore, it considers the problems\nof learning a low-dimensional representation of the input\ndata (through topic modeling) and modeling the answers of\nmultiple annotators jointly, providing an efﬁcient stochastic\nvariational inference algorithm.\nDespite the considerable amount of approaches for\nlearning classiﬁers from the noisy answers of multiple an-\nnotators, for continuous response variables this problem has\nbeen approached in a much smaller extent. For example,\nGroot et al. [24] address this problem in the context of Gaus-\nsian processes. In their work, the authors assign a different\nvariance to the likelihood of the data points provided by the\ndifferent annotators, thereby allowing them to have differ-\nent noise levels, which can be estimated by maximizing the\nmarginal likelihood of the data. Similarly, the authors in [22]\npropose an extension of their own classiﬁcation approach to\nregression problems by assigning different variances to the\nGaussian noise models of the different annotators. In this\narticle, we take this idea one step further by also considering\na per-annotator bias parameter, which gives the proposed\nmodel the ability to overcome certain personal tendencies\nin the annotators labeling styles that are quite common,\nfor example, in product ratings and document reviews.\nFurthermore, we empirically validate the proposed model\nusing real multi-annotator data obtained from Amazon Me-\nchanical Turk. This contrasts with the previously mentioned\nworks, which rely only on simulated annotators.\n3\nCLASSIFICATION MODEL\nIn this section, we develop a multi-\n\n[Learning_Supervised_Topic_Models_for_Classification_and_Regression_from_Crowds p6]\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL.

In com-\nparison to MultiWOZ, our dataset has a compa-\nrable scale: 5,012 dialogues and 84K turns in the\ntraining set. The average number of domains and\nturns per dialogue are larger than those of Multi-\nWOZ, which indicates that our task is more com-\nplex. The cross-domain dependency in our dataset\nis natural and challenging. For example, as shown\nin Table 2, the system needs to recommend a ho-\ntel near the attraction chosen by the user in pre-\nvious turns. Thus, both system recommendation\nand user selection will dynamically impact the di-\nalogue. We also allow the same domain to appear\nmultiple times in a user goal since a tourist may\nwant to go to more than one attraction.\nTo better track the conversation ﬂow and model\nuser dialogue policy, we provide annotation of\nuser states in addition to system states and di-\nalogue acts.\nWhile the system state tracks the\ndialogue history, the user state is maintained by\nthe user and indicates whether the sub-goals have\nbeen completed, which can be used to predict user\nactions. This information will facilitate the con-\nstruction of the user simulator.\nTo the best of our knowledge, CrossWOZ is the\nﬁrst large-scale Chinese dataset for task-oriented\ndialogue systems, which will largely alleviate the\nshortage of Chinese task-oriented dialogue cor-\npora that are publicly available.\n3\nData Collection\nOur corpus is to simulate scenarios where a trav-\neler seeks tourism information and plans her or his\ntravel in Beijing.

Although state-of-the-art CWS systems \nreport a high performance at the level of 95-97%, these systems typically require a large scale of \npre-segmented corpus of tens (if not hundreds) of millions of words for training. However, the \ncollection of the data on such a scale is very time-consuming and resource-intensive. \nOne possible solution to handle this dilemma is to deploy active learning, where only a small \nscale of instances are actively selected to serve as training data so that the annotation effort can \nbe highly reduced (Settles and Craven, 2008). Although active learning has been widely em-\nployed to many NLP tasks, such as word sense disambiguation (Chan and Ng, 2007; Chen et al., \n2006; Fujii et al., 1998), text categorization (Lewis and Gale, 1994; Liere and Tadepalli, 1997; \nMcCallum and Nigam, 1998; Li et al., 2012), and named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004), \nthere are few studies of active learning on CWS, probably due to the strong challenges inherent \nin performing active learning on CWS. \nFirst, the state-of-the-art methods treat CWS as a sequence labelling task (Jiang et al., 2008; Ng \nand Low, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006), i.e. labelling characters with tags from a \npre-defined tag set, representing the position of a character in a word. Different from traditional \nclassification tasks, each character is tagged sequentially according to its corresponding context. \nUnder this circumstance, a character cannot be determined as a single unit to query in active \nlearning. One possible solution is to select one sentence as a unit for annotation, as Sassano (2002) \ndoes for Japanese word segmentation. However, such solution is expensive for annotation and \nsince one se\n\n[DisSim-_A_Discourse-Aware_Syntactic_Text_Simplification_Frameworkfor_English_and_German p4]\nReferences\nMichele Banko, Michael J.

Despite this\nsuccess, Schick and Sch¨utze (2020) recently\nshowed that these models struggle to under-\nstand rare words. For static word embeddings,\nthis problem has been addressed by separately\nlearning representations for rare words.\nIn\nthis work, we transfer this idea to pretrained\nlanguage models: We introduce BERTRAM, a\npowerful architecture based on BERT that is\ncapable of inferring high-quality embeddings\nfor rare words that are suitable as input rep-\nresentations for deep language models. This is\nachieved by enabling the surface form and con-\ntexts of a word to interact with each other in a\ndeep architecture. Integrating BERTRAM into\nBERT leads to large performance increases\ndue to improved representations of rare and\nmedium frequency words on both a rare word\nprobing task and three downstream tasks.1\n1\nIntroduction\nAs word embedding algorithms (e.g. Mikolov et al.,\n2013) are known to struggle with rare words, sev-\neral techniques for improving their representations\nhave been proposed. These approaches exploit ei-\nther the contexts in which rare words occur (Lazari-\ndou et al., 2017; Herbelot and Baroni, 2017; Kho-\ndak et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019a), their surface-\nform (Luong et al., 2013; Bojanowski et al., 2017;\nPinter et al., 2017), or both (Schick and Sch¨utze,\n2019a,b; Hautte et al., 2019). However, all of this\nprior work is designed for and evaluated on uncon-\ntextualized word embeddings.\nContextualized representations obtained from\npretrained deep language models (e.g. Peters et al.,\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu\net al., 2019b) already handle rare words implicitly\n1Our implementation of BERTRAM\n\n[BERTRAM-_Improved_Word_Embeddings_Have_Big_Impact_on_Contextualized_Model_Performance p9]\n[0,125)\n[125,250)\n[250,500)\n[500,∞)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nWord counts\nAccuracy improvement\nBERT+BSL\nRoBERTa+BSL\nBERT+BSL+ID\nRoBERTa+BSL+ID\nFigure 4:\nImprovements for BERT (base) and\nRoBERTa (large) when adding BERTRAM-SLASH\n(+BSL) or BERTRAM-SLASH + INDOMAIN (+BSL+ID)\non MNLI-1000\nprevious rariﬁcation in two respects. First, we in-\ncrease the threshold for a word to count as rare\nfrom 100 to 1000. Second, as this means that we\nhave more WordNet synonyms available, we do not\nuse the misspelling dictionary (Piktus et al., 2019)\nfor substitution. We refer to the resulting datasets\nfor BERTbase and RoBERTalarge as MNLI-1000.\nFigure 4 shows results on MNLI-1000 for var-\nious rare word frequency ranges. For each value\n[c0, c1) on the x-axis, the y-axis shows improve-\nment in accuracy compared to standalone BERT\nor RoBERTa when only dataset entries are con-\nsidered for which each rariﬁed word occurs be-\ntween c0 (inclusively) and c1 (exclusively) times\nin WWC+BooksCorpus. We see that for words\nwith frequency less than 125, the improvement in\naccuracy remains similar even without using mis-\nspellings as another source of substitutions. In-\nterestingly, for every single interval of rare word\ncounts considered, adding BERTRAM-SLASH to\nBERT considerably improves its accuracy. For\nRoBERTa, adding BERTRAM brings improvements\nonly for words occurring less than 500 times.\nWhile using INDOMAIN data is beneﬁcial for\nrare words – simply because it gives us addi-\ntional contexts for these words –, when consid-\nering only words that occur at least 250 times in\nWWC+BookCorpus, adding INDOMAIN contexts\ndoes not help.\n6\nConclusion\nWe have introduced BERTRAM, a novel architec-\nture for inducing high-quality representations for\nrare words in BERT’s and RoBERTa’s embedding\nspaces. This is achieved by employing a powerful\npretrained language model and deeply integrating\nsurface-form and context information. By replac-\ning important words with rare synonyms, we cre-\nated downstream task datasets that a\n\n[BERTRAM-_Improved_Word_Embeddings_Have_Big_Impact_on_Contextualized_Model_Performance p8]\nﬁguration where the BERTRAM-based embedding\nis simply added and both representations are sepa-\nrated using a single slash:\neSLASH = e1, . . . , ej, e/, v(w,C), ej+1, . . . , en .\nThe intuition behind this variant is that in BERT’s\npretraining corpus, a slash is often used to separate\ntwo variants of the same word (e.g., “useable / us-\nable”) or two closely related concepts (e.g., “com-\npany / organization”, “web-based / cloud”) and\nthus, BERT should be able to understand that both\nei, . . . , ej and v(w,C) refer to the same entity. We\ntherefore surmise that whenever some information\nis encoded in one representation but not in the other,\ngiving BERT both representations is helpful.\nBy default, the set of contexts C for each\nword is obtained by collecting all sentences from\nWWC+BookCorpus in which it occurs. We also\ntry a variant where we add in-domain contexts by\ngiving BERTRAM access to all texts (but not la-\nbels) found in the test set; we refer to this variant as\nINDOMAIN.6 Our motivation for including this vari-\nant is as follows: Moving from the training stage of\na model to its production use often causes a slight\ndomain shift. This is turn leads to an increased\nnumber of input sentences containing words that\ndid not – or only very rarely – appear in the training\ndata. However, such input sentences can easily be\ncollected as additional unlabeled examples during\nproduction use. While there is no straightforward\nway to leverage these unlabeled examples with an\nalready ﬁnetuned BERT model, BERTRAM can eas-\nily make use of them without requiring any labels\nor any further training: They can simply be in-\ncluded as additional contexts during inference. As\nthis gives BERTRAM a slight advantage, we ", "prediction_text_only": "The improvement is significant for rare/medum frequency words, but not for rare/medium frequency words.", "prediction_vision_only": "The representaton improvement is significant for both standalone BERT and previous work, but the improvement is more pronounced for standalone BERT.

In com-\nparison to MultiWOZ, our dataset has a compa-\nrable scale: 5,012 dialogues and 84K turns in the\ntraining set. The average number of domains and\nturns per dialogue are larger than those of Multi-\nWOZ, which indicates that our task is more com-\nplex. The cross-domain dependency in our dataset\nis natural and challenging. For example, as shown\nin Table 2, the system needs to recommend a ho-\ntel near the attraction chosen by the user in pre-\nvious turns. Thus, both system recommendation\nand user selection will dynamically impact the di-\nalogue. We also allow the same domain to appear\nmultiple times in a user goal since a tourist may\nwant to go to more than one attraction.\nTo better track the conversation ﬂow and model\nuser dialogue policy, we provide annotation of\nuser states in addition to system states and di-\nalogue acts.\nWhile the system state tracks the\ndialogue history, the user state is maintained by\nthe user and indicates whether the sub-goals have\nbeen completed, which can be used to predict user\nactions. This information will facilitate the con-\nstruction of the user simulator.\nTo the best of our knowledge, CrossWOZ is the\nﬁrst large-scale Chinese dataset for task-oriented\ndialogue systems, which will largely alleviate the\nshortage of Chinese task-oriented dialogue cor-\npora that are publicly available.\n3\nData Collection\nOur corpus is to simulate scenarios where a trav-\neler seeks tourism information and plans her or his\ntravel in Beijing.

However, the research is still largely limited by the availability of large-scale high-quality dialogue data. Many corpora have advanced the research of task-oriented dialogue systems, most of which are single domain conversations, including ATIS (Hemphill et al., 1990), DSTC 2 (Henderson et al., 2014), Frames (El Asri et al., 2017), KVRET (Eric et al., 2017), WOZ 2.0 (Wen et al., 2017) and M2M (Shah et al., 2018).\n\nDespite the significant contributions to the community, these datasets are still limited in size, language variation, or task complexity. Furthermore, there is a gap between existing dialogue corpora and real-life human dialogue data. In real-life conversations, it is natural for humans to transition between different domains or scenarios while still maintaining coherent contexts. Thus, real-life dialogues are much more complicated than those dialogues that are only simulated within a single domain. To address this issue, some multi-domain corpora have been proposed (Budzianowski et al., ; Rastogi et al., 2019). The most notable corpus is MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., ), a large-scale multi-domain dataset which consists of crowdsourced human-to-human dialogues. It contains 10K dialogue sessions and 143K utterances for 7 domains, with annotation of system-side dialogue states and dialogue acts. However, the state annotations are noisy (Eric et al., 2019), and user-side dialogue acts are missing. The dependency across domains is simply embodied in imposing the same prespecified constraints on different domains, such as requiring both a hotel and an attraction to locate in the center of the town.\n\nIn comparison to the abundance of English dialogue data, surprisingly, there is still no widely recognized Chinese task-oriented dialogue corpus. In this paper, we propose **CrossWOZ**, a large-scale Chinese multi-domain (cross-domain) task-oriented dialogue dataset. An dialogue example is shown in Figure 1. We compare **CrossWOZ** to other corpora in Table 1 and 2. Our dataset has the following features comparing to other corpora (particularly MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., )):\n\n1. 1.The dependency between domains is more challenging because the choice in one do", "prediction_text_plus_vision": "The dataset for word probing task is a large-scale Chinese cross-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset.

Hypothesis Embedding Concatenation\nThe concatenation of hypothesized text leverages the n-best\nlist by transferring information among hypotheses in an em-\nbedding framework, BiLSTM. However, since all the layers\nhave access to both the preceding and subsequent informa-\ntion, the embedding among n-bests will inﬂuence each other,\nwhich confuses the embedding and makes the whole frame-\nwork sensitive to the noise in hypotheses.\nAs the second group of integration approaches, we de-\nvelop models, PoolingAvg/Max, on the concatenation of hy-\npothesis embedding, which isolate the embedding process\namong hypotheses and summarize the features by a pooling\nlayer. For each hypothesis (e.g., ith best in Eqn. 3 with j\npairs of bytes), we could get a sequence of hidden states from\nBiLSTM and obtain its ﬁnal output state by concatenating\nthe ﬁrst and last hidden state (houtputi in Eqn. 4). Then, we\nstack all the output states vertically as shown in Eqn. 5. Note\nthat in the real data, we will not always have a ﬁxed size of\nhypotheses list. For a list with r (< n) interpretations, we get\nthe embedding for each of them and pad with the embedding\nof the ﬁrst best hypothesis until a ﬁxed size n. When r ≥n,\nwe only stack the top n embeddings. We employ houtput1\nfor padding to enhance the inﬂuence of the top 1 hypothesis,\nwhich is more reliable. Finally, one uniﬁed representation\ncould be achieved via Pooling (Max/Avg pooling with n by\n1 sliding window and stride 1) on the concatenation and one\nscore could be produced per possible tag for the given task.\n\n[Procedural_Reasoning_Networks_for_Understanding_Multimodal_Procedures p6]\n3.5\nOutput Module\nThe output module takes the output of the mod-\neling module, encoding vector embeddings of the\nquestion-aware recipe and the entities Y, and the\nembedding of the answer A, and returns a simi-\nlarity score which is used while determining the\ncorrect answer.

While determining the ingredients,\nwe exploit Recipe1M (Marin et al., 2018) and\nKaggle Whats Cooking Recipes (Yummly, 2015)\ndatasets, and form our dictionary using the most\ncommonly used ingredients in the training set of\nRecipeQA. For the cases when no entity can be\nextracted from the recipe automatically (20 recipes\nin total), we manually annotate those recipes with\nthe related entities.\n4.2\nTraining Details\nIn our experiments, we separately trained models\non each task, as well as we investigated multi-task\nlearning where a single model is trained to solve all\nthese tasks at once. In total, the PRN architecture\nconsists of ∼12M trainable parameters. We imple-\nmented our models in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017)\nusing AllenNLP library (Gardner et al., 2018).

Then,\nin Eqn. 2, the MLP module deﬁnes the probability of a spe-\nciﬁc tag (domain or intent) ˜t as the normalized activation (σ)\noutput after linear transformation of the output vector.\n3.2. Hypothesis Embedding Concatenation\nThe concatenation of hypothesized text leverages the n-best\nlist by transferring information among hypotheses in an em-\nbedding framework, BiLSTM. However, since all the layers\nhave access to both the preceding and subsequent informa-\ntion, the embedding among n-bests will inﬂuence each other,\nwhich confuses the embedding and makes the whole frame-\nwork sensitive to the noise in hypotheses.\nAs the second group of integration approaches, we de-\nvelop models, PoolingAvg/Max, on the concatenation of hy-\npothesis embedding, which isolate the embedding process\namong hypotheses and summarize the features by a pooling\nlayer. For each hypothesis (e.g., ith best in Eqn. 3 with j\npairs of bytes), we could get a sequence of hidden states from\nBiLSTM and obtain its ﬁnal output state by concatenating\nthe ﬁrst and last hidden state (houtputi in Eqn. 4). Then, we\nstack all the output states vertically as shown in Eqn. 5. Note\nthat in the real data, we will not always have a ﬁxed size of\nhypotheses list. For a list with r (< n) interpretations, we get\nthe embedding for each of them and pad with the embedding\nof the ﬁrst best hypothesis until a ﬁxed size n. When r ≥n,\nwe only stack the top n embeddings. We employ houtput1\nfor padding to enhance the inﬂuence of the top 1 hypothesis,\nwhich is more reliable. Finally, one uniﬁed representation\ncould be achieved via Pooling (Max/Avg pooling with n by\n1 sliding window and stride 1) on the concatenation and one\nscore could be produced per possible tag for the given task.\n\n[Important_Attribute_Identification_in_Knowledge_Graph p10]\n10\n.\napproach to the seller, we choose to keep 5 most important attributes for each\ncategory.\nEvaluation is conducted by comparing the output of the systems with the\nmanual annotated answers, and we calculate the precision and recall rate.\nPrecision =\nP\nattr∈Ma & attr∈Sa 1\nP\nattr∈Sa 1\nRecall =\nP\nattr∈Ma & attr∈Sa 1\nP\nattr∈Ma 1\nwhere Ma is the manually labeled attributes , Sa is the detected important\nattributes.\nTable 1 depicts the algorithm performance of each category and the overall\naverage metrics among all categories for our approach and other methods.

For all possible conﬁgurations, we recorded the val-\nues of the training and validation loss (cross entropy) after each epoch. Tracking\nthese metrics serves as a minimalistic sanity check: if the model is not able to\nsolve the word prediction task with some degree of success (e.g. if we observe no\nsubstantial decay in the losses) then one should not expect the embeddings to\ncapture any of the distributional information they are supposed to capture.\n4.3\nTests and Gold-Standard Data for Intrinsic Evaluation\nUsing the gold standard data (described below), we performed three types of\ntests:\n– Class Membership Tests: embeddings corresponding two member of the\nsame semantic class (e.g. “Months of the Year”, “Portuguese Cities”, “Smi-\nleys”) should be close, since they are supposed to be found in mostly the\nsame contexts.\n– Class Distinction Test: this is the reciprocal of the previous Class Mem-\nbership test.

In the next step, all three representa-\ntions are concatenated and passed into a MLP with\ntwo layers, 1024 units each and ReLu activation\nfunction. During training, the MLP is supposed to\nlearn a non-linear combination of its input repre-\nsentations. Finally, the output layer does the actual\nclassiﬁcation. In the SoftMax output layer each\nunit corresponds to a class label. For sub-task A\nthe output dimension is eight. We treat sub-task\nB as a standard multi-label classiﬁcation problem,\ni. e., we neglect any hierarchical information. Ac-\ncordingly, the output layer for sub-task B has 343\nunits. When the value of an output unit is above\na given threshold the corresponding label is pre-\ndicted, whereby thresholds are deﬁned separately\nfor each class. The optimum was found by varying\nthe threshold in steps of 0.1 in the interval from 0\nto 1.\n4.5\nImplementation\nTraining is performed with batch size b = 16,\ndropout probability d = 0.1, learning rate η =\n2−5 (Adam optimizer) and 5 training epochs.\nThese hyperparameters are the ones proposed by\nDevlin et al.

If there is no single label for which predic-\ntion probability is above the classiﬁcation thresh-\nold, the most popular label (Literatur & Unterhal-\ntung) is used as prediction.\n4.6\nBaseline\nTo compare against a relatively simple baseline,\nwe implemented a Logistic Regression classiﬁer\nchain from scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).\nThis baseline uses the text only and converts it\nto TF-IDF vectors. As with the BERT model, it\nperforms 8-class multi-label classiﬁcation for sub-\ntask A and 343-class multi-label classiﬁcation for\nsub-task B, ignoring the hierarchical aspect in the\nlabels.\n5\nResults\nTable 2 shows the results of our experimen\n\n[Enriching_BERT_with_Knowledge_Graph_Embeddings_for_Document_Classification p2]\nof representation that is able to model various di-\nmensions and characteristics of arbitrary text gen-\nres. The size of the challenge can be illustrated\nby the observation that there is no clear agreement\namong researchers regarding actual genre labels or\ntheir scope and consistency. There is a substan-\ntial amount of previous work on the deﬁnition of\ngenre taxonomies, genre ontologies, or sets of la-\nbels (Biber, 1988; Lee, 2002; Sharoff, 2018; Un-\nderwood, 2014; Rehm, 2005). Since we work with\nthe dataset provided by the organisers of the 2019\nGermEval shared task, we adopt their hierarchy of\nlabels as our genre palette. In the following, we\nfocus on related work more relevant to our contri-\nbution.\nWith regard to text and document classiﬁca-\ntion, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representa-\ntions from Transformers) (Devlin et al., 2019) is\na pre-trained embedding model that yields state\nof the art results in a wide span of NLP tasks,\nsuch as question answering, textual entailment and\nnatural language inference learning (Artetxe and\nSchwenk, 2018). Adhikari et al. (2019) are among\nthe ﬁrst to apply BERT to document classiﬁca-\ntion. Acknowledging challenges like incorporat-\ning syntactic information, or predicting multiple\nlabels, they describe how they adapt BERT for\nthe document classiﬁcation task. In general, they\nintroduce a fully-connected layer over the ﬁnal\nhidden state that contains one neuron each repre-\nsenting an input token, and further optimize the\nmodel choosing soft-max classiﬁer parameters to\nweight the hidden state layer. They report state\nof the art results in experiments based on four\npopular datasets. An approach exploiting Hierar-\nchical Attention Networks is presented by Yang\net al. (2016). Their model introduces a hierarchi-\ncal structure to represent the hierarchical nature\nof a document. Yang et al. (2016) derive atten-\ntion on the word and sentence level, which makes\nthe attention mechanisms react ﬂexibly to long and\nshort distant context inf\n\n[Classification_Betters_Regression_in_Query-based_Multi-document_Summarisation_Techniques_for_Questio p2]\n2\nDiego Moll´a and Christopher Jones\n1. We compare classiﬁcation and regression approaches and show that classiﬁ-\ncation produces better results than regression but the quality of the results\ndepends on the approach followed to annotate the data labels.\n2. We conduct correlation analysis between various ROUGE evaluation metrics\nand the human evaluations conducted at BioASQ and show that Precision\nand F1 correlate better than Recall.\nSection 2 brieﬂy introduces some related work for context.

While\nthe model correctly predicts the second level label\nGesundheit & Ern¨ahrung (health & diet), it misses\nthe corresponding ﬁrst level label Ratgeber (advi-\nsor).

Phase B provides a biomedical question and a list of relevant articles and snippets, and participant systems are expected to return the exact answers and the ideal answers. The training data is composed of the test data from all previous years, and amounts to 2,747 samples.\n\nThere has been considerable research on the use of machine learning approaches for tasks related to text summarisation, especially on single-document summarisation. Abstractive approaches normally use an encoder-decoder architecture and variants of this architecture incorporate attention [10] and pointer-generator [11]. Recent approaches leveraged the use of pre-trained models [2]. Recent extractive approaches to summarisation incorporate recurrent neural networks that model sequences of sentence extractions [8] and may incorporate an abstractive component and reinforcement learning during the training stage [13]. But relatively few approaches have been proposed for query-based multi-document summarisation.

The reason for this difference might be the fact that [3] used all sentences from the abstracts of the relevant PubMed articles, whereas we use only the snippets as the input to our summariser. Consequently, the number of input sentences is now much smaller.

We validate our approach by\nlookup in the UniMorph corpora and ﬁnd a\nmacro-average of 64.13% recall. We also note\nincompatibilities due to paucity of data on ei-\nther side. Finally, we present a critical evalu-\nation of the foundations, strengths, and weak-\nnesses of the two annotation projects.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe two largest standardized, cross-lingual datasets\nfor morphological annotation are provided by the\nUniversal Dependencies (UD; Nivre et al., 2017)\nand Universal Morphology (UniMorph; Sylak-\nGlassman et al., 2015; Kirov et al., 2018) projects.\nEach project’s data are annotated according to its\nown cross-lingual schema, prescribing how fea-\ntures like gender or case should be marked. The\nschemata capture largely similar information, so\none may want to leverage both UD’s token-level\ntreebanks and UniMorph’s type-level lookup tables\nand unify the two resources. This would permit a\nleveraging of both the token-leve\n\n[Marrying_Universal_Dependencies_and_Universal_Morphology p9]\nthat in every case, tagging F1 increased—albeit by\namounts as small as 0.16 points. This is in part\ndue to the information that is lost in the conversion.\nUniMorph’s schema does not indicate the type of\npronoun (demonstrative, interrogative, etc.), and\nwhen lexical information is not recorded in Uni-\nMorph, we delete it from the MSD during trans-\nformation. On the other hand, UniMorph’s atomic\ntags have more parts to guess, but they are often\nrelated. (E.g. IPFV always entails PST in Spanish.)\nAltogether, these forces seem to have little impact\non tagging performance.\n8\nRelated Work\nThe goal of a tagset-to-tagset mapping of mor-\nphological annotations is shared by the Interset\nproject (Zeman, 2008). Interset decodes features\nin the source corpus to a tag interlingua, then en-\ncodes that into target corpus features. (The idea of\nan interlingua is drawn from machine translation,\nwhere a prevailing early mindset was to convert to\na universal representation, then encode that repre-\nsentation’s semantics in the target language. Our\napproach, by contrast, is a direct ﬂight from the\nsource to the target.) Because UniMorph corpora\nare noisy, the encoding from the interlingua would\nhave to be rewritten for each target. Further, de-\ncoding the UD MSD into the interlingua cannot\nleverage external information like the lemma and\nform.\nThe creators of HamleDT sought to harmonize\ndependency annotations among treebanks, similar\nto our goal of harmonizing across resources (Ze-\nman et al., 2014). The treebanks they sought to har-\nmonize used multiple diverse annotation schemes,\nwhich the authors uniﬁed under a single scheme.\nPetrov et al. (2012) present mappings into a\ncoarse, “universal” part of speech for 22 languages.\nWorking with POS tags rather than morphological\ntags (which have far more dim", "prediction_text_only": "Yes, they do.", "prediction_vision_only": "Yes, they do.", "prediction_text_plus_vision": "Yes, they do.

To ease this interoperability,\nwe present a deterministic mapping from Uni-\nversal Dependencies v2 features into the Uni-\nMorph schema. We validate our approach by\nlookup in the UniMorph corpora and ﬁnd a\nmacro-average of 64.13% recall. We also note\nincompatibilities due to paucity of data on ei-\nther side.

This would permit a leveraging of both the token-level UD treebanks and the type-level UniMorph tables of paradigms. Unfortunately, neither resource perfectly realizes this goal.\n\nFigure 1: Example of annotation disagreement in UD between two languages on translations of one phrase, reproduced from Malaviya et al.
