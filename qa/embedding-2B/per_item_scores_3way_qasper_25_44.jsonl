Introduction\n\nCharacteristic metrics are a set of unsupervised measures that quantitatively describe or summarize the properties of a data collection. These metrics generally do not use ground-truth labels and only measure the intrinsic characteristics of data. The most prominent example is descriptive statistics that summarizes a data collection by a group of unsupervised measures such as mean or median for central tendency, variance or minimum-maximum for dispersion, skewness for symmetry, and kurtosis for heavy-tailed analysis.\n\nIn recent years, text classification, a category of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, has drawn much attention (Zhang et al., 2015; Joulin et al., 2016; Howard and Ruder, 2018) for its wide-ranging real-world applications such as fake news detection (Shu et al., 2017), document classification (Yang et al., 2016), and spoken language understanding (SLU) (Gupta et al., 2019a; Gupta et al., 2019b; Zhang et al., 2018), a core task of conversational assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.\n\nHowever, there are still insufficient characteristic metrics to describe a collection of texts. Unlike numeric or categorical data, simple descriptive statistics alone such as word counts and vocabulary size are difficult to capture the syntactic and semantic properties of a text collection.\n\nIn this work, we propose a set of characteristic metrics: diversity, density, and homogeneity to quantitatively summarize a collection of texts where the unit of texts could be a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. A text collection is first mapped into a high-dimensional embedding space. Our characteristic metrics are then computed to measure the dispersion, sparsity, and uniformity of the distribution. Based on the choice of embedding methods, these characteristic metrics can help understand the properties of a text collection from different linguistic perspectives, for example,\n\n1These authors contributed equally.\n*Work done as a Principal Scientist at AWS AI.\n\nLexical diversity, syntactic variation, and semantic homogeneity. Our proposed diversity, density, and homogeneity metrics extract hard-to-visualize quantitative insight for a better understanding and comparison between text collections.\n\nTo verify the effectiveness of proposed characteristic metrics, we first conduct a series of simulation experiments that cover various scenarios in two-dimensional as well as high-dimensional vector spaces. The results show that our proposed quantitative characteristic metrics exhibit several desirable and intuitive properties such as robustness and linear sensitivity of the diversity metric with respect to random down-sampling. Besides, we investigate the relationship between the characteristic metrics and the performance of a renowned model, BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), on the text classification task using two public benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that there are high correlations between text classification model performance and the characteristic metrics, which shows the efficacy of our proposed metrics.\n\n2. Related Work\n\nA building block of characteristic metrics for text collections is the language representation method. A classic way to represent a sentence or a paragraph is n-gram, with dimension equals to the size of vocabulary. More advanced methods learn a relatively low dimensional latent space that represents each word or token as a continuous semantic vector such as word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), and fastText (Mikolov et al., 2017). These methods have been widely adopted with consistent performance improvements on many NLP tasks. Also, there has been extensive research on representing a whole sentence as a vector such as a plain or weighted average of word vectors (Arora et al., 2016), skip-thought vectors (Kiros et al., 2015), and self-attentive sentence enc", "prediction_vision_only__f1": 0.035523978685612786, "prediction_vision_only__em": 0.0, "prediction_vision_only__meteor": 0.1067796269496704, "prediction_vision_only__rouge_l": 0.035523978685612786, "prediction_text_plus_vision": "Yes, they proposed the diversity, density and homogeneity metrics.", "prediction_text_plus_vision__f1": 0.5, "prediction_text_plus_vision__em": 0.0, "prediction_text_plus_vision__meteor": 0.37006578947368424, "prediction_text_plus_vision__rouge_l": 0.5}

The concept of “rich” is actually qualitative, and obscure to define in different applications. We empirically provide a formula to measure the richness in the scenario of machine translation.\n\nThe greater, the richer. In practice, we find a rough threshold of r is 5\n\nFirst, the Plackett-Luce models boost the training BLEU very greatly, even up to 2.5 points higher than MIRA. This verifies our assumption, richer features benefit BLEU, though they are optimized towards a different objective.\n\nSecond, the over-fitting problem of the Plackett-Luce models PL($k$) is alleviated with moderately large $k$. In PL(1), the over-fitting is quite obvious, the portion in which the curve overpasses MIRA is the smallest compared to other $k$, and its convergent performance is below the baseline.

Embeddings of elements of different classes should be different, since words of different classes ere expected to be found in significantly different contexts.\n\nWord Equivalence Test: embeddings corresponding to synonyms, antonyms, abbreviations (e.g. “porque\" abbreviated by “pq\") and partial references (e.g. “slb and benfica\") should be almost equal, since both alternatives are supposed to be used be interchangeable in all contexts (either maintaining or inverting the meaning).\n\nTherefore, in our tests, two words are considered:\n\ndistinct if the cosine of the corresponding embeddings is lower than 0.70 (or 0.80).\n\nto belong to the same class if the cosine of their embeddings is higher than 0.70 (or 0.80).\n\nequivalent if the cosine of the embeddings is higher that 0.85 (or 0.95).\n\nFor all these tests we computed a coverage metric. Our embeddings do not necessarily contain information for all the words contained in each of these tests. So, for all tests, we compute a coverage metric that measures the fraction of the gold-standard pairs that could actually be tested using the different embeddings produced.\n\nThen, for all the test pairs actually covered, we obtain the success metrics for each of the 3 tests by computing the ratio of pairs we were able to correctly classified as i) being distinct (cosine INLINEFORM0 0.7 or 0.8), ii) belonging to the same class (cosine INLINEFORM1 0.7 or 0.8), and iii) being equivalent (cosine INLINEFORM2 0.85 or 0.95).", "title": "Learning Word Embeddings from the Portuguese Twitter Stream: A Study of some Practical Aspects", "doc": "", "prediction_text_only": "The intrinsic evaluation metrics used are ROUGE-2, ROUGE-SU4, and\nF1.", "prediction_text_only__f1": 0.039344262295081964, "prediction_text_only__em": 0.0, "prediction_text_only__meteor": 0.018050125582788627, "prediction_text_only__rouge_l": 0.03278688524590164, "prediction_vision_only": "The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different amounts of training data, for each size of vocabulary, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected for each of the values of \\(|V|\\) is shown in Table 1.\n\nQuestion: What is the impact of using different types of tests, on the embedding space?\nAnswer: The number of examples collected", "prediction_vision_only__f1": 0.1162227602905569, "prediction_vision_only__em": 0.0, "prediction_vision_only__meteor": 0.12718914761205508, "prediction_vision_only__rouge_l": 0.10895883777239708, "prediction_text_plus_vision": "The revised Kendall correlation metric is used.", "prediction_text_plus_vision__f1": 0.019999999999999997, "prediction_text_plus_vision__em": 0.0, "prediction_text_plus_vision__meteor": 0.005656108597285067, "prediction_text_plus_vision__rouge_l": 0.01333333333333333}

The authors propose the use of pLSA to extract the latent topics, and the use of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier using the documents' topics distributions. For this baseline, unsupervised LDA is used instead of pLSA, and the labels from the different annotators for kNN (with INLINEFORM0 ) are aggregated using majority voting (mv).\n\nThe results obtained by the different approaches for the LabelMe data are shown in Fig. FIGREF94 , where the svi version is using mini-batches of 200 documents.\n\nAnalyzing the results for the Reuters-21578 and LabelMe data, we can observe that MA-sLDAc outperforms all the baselines, with slightly better accuracies for the batch version, especially in the Reuters data. Interestingly, the second best results are consistently obtained by the multi-annotator approaches, which highlights the need for accounting for the noise and biases of the answers of the different annotators.\n\nBoth the batch and the stochastic variational inference (svi) versions of the proposed model (MA-sLDAc) are compared with the following baselines:\n\n[itemsep=0.02cm]\n\nLDA + LogReg (mv): This baseline corresponds to applying unsupervised LDA to the data, and learning a logistic regression classifier on the inferred topics distributions of the documents.

Then, we used the metro information of entities in HAR domains to build the metro database. For the taxi domain, there is no need to store the information.

One is to constrain two targets that locate near each other. The other is to use a taxi or metro to commute between two targets in HAR domains mentioned in the context. To make workers understand the task more easily, we crafted templates to generate natural language descriptions for each structured goal.\n\nDialogue Collection: before the formal data collection starts, we required the workers to make a small number of dialogues and gave them feedback about the dialogue quality. Then, well-trained workers were paired to converse according to the given goals. The workers were also asked to annotate both user states and system states.\n\nDialogue Annotation: we used some rules to automatically annotate dialogue acts according to user states, system states, and dialogue histories. To evaluate the quality of the annotation of dialogue acts and states, three experts were employed to manually annotate dialogue acts and states for 50 dialogues.

It contains 6K dialogue sessions and 102K utterances for 5 domains, including hotel, restaurant, attraction, metro, and taxi. Moreover, the corpus contains rich annotation of dialogue states and dialogue acts at both user and system sides. About 60% of the dialogues have cross-domain user goals that favor inter-domain dependency and encourage natural transition across domains in conversation. We also provide a user simulator and several benchmark models for pipelined task-oriented dialogue systems, which will facilitate researchers to compare and evaluate their models on this corpus. The large size and rich annotation of **CrossWOZ** make it suitable to investigate a variety of tasks in cross-domain dialogue modeling, such as dialogue state tracking, policy learning, user simulation, etc.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRecently, there have been a variety of task-oriented dialogue models thanks to the prosperity of neural architectures (Yao et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2015; Mrkšić et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2018; Gür et al., 2018). However, the research is still largely limited by the availability of large-scale high-quality dialogue data. Many corpora have advanced the research of task-oriented dialogue systems, most of which are single domain conversations, including ATIS (Hemphill et al., 1990), DSTC 2 (Henderson et al., 2014), Frames (El Asri et al., 2017), KVRET (Eric et al., 2017), WOZ 2.0 (Wen et al., 2017) and M2M (Shah et al., 2018).\n\nDespite the significant contributions to the community, these datasets are still limited in size, language variation, or task complexity. Furthermore, there is a gap between existing dialogue corpora and real-life human dialogue data. In real-life conversations, it is natural for humans to transition between different domains or scenarios while still maintaining coherent contexts. Thus, real-life dialogues are much more complicated than those dialogues that are only simulated within a single domain. To address this issue, some multi-domain corpora have been proposed (Budzianowski et al., ; Rastogi et al., 2019). The most notable corpus is MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., ), a large-scale multi-domain dataset which consists of crowdsourced human-to-human dialogues. It contains 10K dialogue sessions and 143K utterances for 7 domains, with annotation of system-side dialogue states and dialogue acts. However, the state annotations are noisy (Eric et al., 2019), and user-side dialogue acts are missing. The dependency across domains is simply embodied in imposing the same prespecified constraints on different domains, such as requiring both a hotel and an attraction to locate in the center of the town.\n\nIn comparison to the abundance of English dialogue data, surprisingly, there is still no widely recognized Chinese task-oriented dialogue corpus. In this paper, we propose **CrossWOZ**, a large-scale Chinese multi-domain (cross-domain) task-oriented dialogue dataset. An dialogue example is shown in Figure 1. We compare **CrossWOZ** to other corpora in Table 1 and 2. Our dataset has the following features comparing to other corpora (particularly MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al., )):\n\n1. 1.The dependency between domains is more challenging because the choice in one do", "prediction_vision_only__f1": 0.015841584158415842, "prediction_vision_only__em": 0.0, "prediction_vision_only__meteor": 0.03514938488576451, "prediction_vision_only__rouge_l": 0.015841584158415842, "prediction_text_plus_vision": "The dataset for word probing task is a large-scale Chinese cross-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset.

Every year there has been a task about semantic indexing (task a) and another about question answering (task b), and occasionally there have been additional tasks. The tasks defined for 2019 are:\n\n**BioASQ Task 7a:** Large Scale Online Biomedical Semantic Indexing.\n\n**BioASQ Task 7b:** Biomedical Semantic QA involving Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), and Summarisation.\n\n**BioASQ MESINESP Task:** Medical Semantic Indexing in Spanish.\n\nBioASQ Task 7b consists of two phases. Phase A provides a biomedical question as an input, and participants are expected to find relevant concepts from designated terminologies and ontologies, relevant articles from PubMed, relevant snippets from the relevant articles, and relevant RDF triples from designated ontologies. Phase B provides a biomedical question and a list of relevant articles and snippets, and participant systems are expected to return the exact answers and the ideal answers. The training data is composed of the test data from all previous years, and amounts to 2,747 samples.\n\nThere has been considerable research on the use of machine learning approaches for tasks related to text summarisation, especially on single-document summarisation. Abstractive approaches normally use an encoder-decoder architecture and variants of this architecture incorporate attention [10] and pointer-generator [11]. Recent approaches leveraged the use of pre-trained models [2]. Recent extractive approaches to summarisation incorporate recurrent neural networks that model sequences of sentence extractions [8] and may incorporate an abstractive component and reinforcement learning during the training stage [13]. But relatively few approaches have been proposed for query-based multi-document summarisation.

that classification outperforms regression. However, the actual choice of optimal labelling scheme was different: whereas in [3] the optimal labelling was based on a labelling threshold of 0.1, our experiments show a better result when using the top 5 sentences as the target summary. The reason for this difference might be the fact that [3] used all sentences from the abstracts of the relevant PubMed articles, whereas we use only the snippets as the input to our summariser. Consequently, the number of input sentences is now much smaller. We therefore report the results of using the labelling schema of top 5 snippets in all subsequent classifier-based experiments of this paper.\n\nTable 3.

This suggests that the annotations in the UD treebanks are reliable and can be used to improve the quality of the Universal Dependencies treebanks.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nThe two largest standardized, cross-lingual datasets for morphological annotation are provided by the Universal Dependencies (UD; Nivre et al., 2017) and Universal Morphology (UniMorph; Sylak-Glassman et al., 2015; Kirov et al., 2018) projects. Each project's data are annotated according to its own cross-lingual schema, prescribing how features like gender or case should be marked. The schemata capture largely similar information, so one may want to leverage both UD's token-level treebanks and UniMorph's type-level lookup tables and unify the two resources. This would permit a leveraging of both the token-level UD treebanks and the type-level UniMorph tables of paradigms. Unfortunately, neither resource perfectly realizes this goal.\n\nFigure 1: Example of annotation disagreement in UD between two languages on translations of one phrase, reproduced from Malaviya et al. (2018). The final word in each, “_refrescante_”, is not inflected for gender: It has the same surface form whether masculine or feminine. Only in Portuguese, it is annotated as masculine to reflect grammatical concord with the noun it modifies.", "prediction_vision_only__f1": 0.02714932126696833, "prediction_vision_only__em": 0.0, "prediction_vision_only__meteor": 0.07662835249042148, "prediction_vision_only__rouge_l": 0.01809954751131222, "prediction_text_plus_vision": "Yes, they do.", "prediction_text_plus_vision__f1": 0.0, "prediction_text_plus_vision__em": 0.0, "prediction_text_plus_vision__meteor": 0.0, "prediction_text_plus_vision__rouge_l": 0.0}
